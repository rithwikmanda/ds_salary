Our team values diversity in experience and backgrounds—we do our best work when we create space for different voices and perspectives. Whatever unique experiences or skill sets you bring, we look forward to learning from each other.

What You'll Do:
Conduct exploratory data analysis across disparate data sources (e.g. website usage, dealer behavior patterns and customer insights) to understand the performance of existing products and see opportunities for new product offerings
Partner with the product, engineering, marketing, sales, and finance departments to grow our business, including recommending and advocating for performance improvement ideas
Define metrics to evaluate business performance, products and experiments; build reports and dashboards to monitor and understand them
Communicate and present data analysis, visualizations, and insights to key stakeholders
Be a voice and advocate for using data to improve the quality of our decision making
Mentor data analysts on technical and professional development

LogRocket was founded in 2016 by Matthew Arbesfeld and Ben Edelstein, a computer science duo who have been building products together since the third grade. Frustrated by how difficult it was to understand their customers' experiences, Arbesfeld and Edelstein set out toward an audacious goal: to make every experience on the web as perfect as possible.

Our team is a diverse group that brings an eclectic set of experiences from Google, Meteor, Drift, HubSpot, MIT, and Columbia. We enjoy eating lunch together every day in our airy downtown Boston office, learning more about each other at our show-and-tell sessions, and hosting our friends during #logrocketeer events. We focus on building our software with care and craftsmanship — our engineering blog posts offer a taste of that — and we welcome talented people from all backgrounds.

The Data Science and Analytics team is responsible for characterizing, modeling, and predicting the evolving behavior and performance of smart electric utility systems through synergistic utilization of smart grid data coupled with the state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence and power system first principles. With the projected increase in utility IoT deployments and grid modernization programs, the amount of operational and non-operational data is exploding. Deriving business value from these investments requires both small data and big data pipelines and applications to effectively ingest, store, and analyze millions of daily raw data points that ultimately lead to transformative business outcomes.

Individuals in these roles are expected to work within the Data Science and Analytics team to develop and maintain signal processing and machine learning models and pipelines based on best practices that allow for characterization and analysis of smart grid behavior and its components during steady-state, dynamic, and transient conditions. This position will support scenario analysis and digital modeling of the grid that ultimately help create a digital twin of a target system and its components. The Data Science and Analytics team harnesses the power of artificial intelligence and domain-based edge and cloud analytics to help solve previously unsolvable digital grid problems, making the world a better place -one algorithm at a time! Our solutions help our customers streamline operations, enhance system reliability, increase safety, enable DER integration, and accelerate business outcomes from grid digitalization initiatives.

This position offers a unique and exciting opportunity to advance the state of the art in utility analytics by working with real and simulated field data from intelligent sensors and operational systems in the rapidly developing and highly visible electric utility space within the Green Energy sector. The innovation and creativity with which we develop and implement utility solutions are among the distinctions that make Sentient Energy - a Koch Engineered Solutions Company- a leader in Distribution Network sensing and analytics.

This role is open to remote/ work from home candidates with preference to sit in Santa Clara, CA, Frisco, TX, New York City, NY, Denver, CO, Wichita, KS, or Tulsa, OK.

What You Will Do In Your Role
Build and maintain machine learning models and embedded algorithms of various fidelity to characterize and predict power grid behavior during steady state, dynamic, and transient conditions with and without distributed energy resources (DERs).
Setup and optimize appropriate data processing pipelines based on best practices in data science that allow for quick testing of various hypothesis at-scale with millions of growing records available from field devices.
Support the Analytics team with thought-provoking ideas and broader analytics know-how from adjacent verticals
Assist product engineering teams with validation and verification of end-to-end sensor system performance.
Help analyze grid events and failure signatures to create a complete picture of an outage or disturbance.
Contribute to utility analytics partnership initiatives and roadmap development
Contribute to intellectual property development and company representations in technical conferences and trade shows
Contribute to 3rd party funded R&D programs and initiatives
Publish internal reports and external articles and white papers to showcase company success and maintain industry thought leadership
The Experience You Will Bring

Business: Boys Town National Research Hospital

Boys Town National Research Hospital (BTNRH) is seeking Junior, Mid, or Senior career level Research Scientists in the Center for Childhood Deafness, Language & Learning (CCDLL). The Center for Childhood Deafness, Language, and Learning is directed by Karla McGregor, Ph.D.

Scientists at Boys Town National Research Hospital are full-time researchers with no teaching or administrative responsibilities and reasonable service commitments.

Our vision is to grow the CCDLL into a program with tightly integrated research and clinical arms that work synergistically on issues of language learning and development. Work that fits this focus could involve examination of differences between learners with varying diagnoses; determination of the influences of intervention as well as family, academic, and social environments on language outcomes; identification of developmental processes that support language learning during infancy, childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood; and investigation of brain plasticity and neurologic pathways that support language learning and development. We are assembling a faculty that can offer a unique perspective on such issues, one that is informed by a commitment to understanding and ameliorating the effects of childhood disabilities on language learning and development.
All scientists will have access to new, state-of-the art laboratory facilities, generous start-up funds, and extensive supports for grant management, IT, participant recruitment, and clinical measurement.
Senior scientists aim for 50% salary support on external grants. Via participation in the Center for Perception and Communication in Children (CPCC) funded by a Centers of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) grant, junior scientists are provided with extensive mentoring and three years of full support to enable them to reach this goal.
